        <h1>What is aXe?</h1>
        Deque System’s aXe (The Accessibility Engine) open source library is a lightweight (~100 KB), fast, portable JavaScript library that executes automated accessibility testing inside your testing framework or browser of choice.

        Re-written from scratch over the last year, leveraging 15 years of accessibility experience, these rules represent the state of the art in automated accessibility testing.

        Have you automated a large amount of your functional testing, but accessibility is being done in an ad-hoc fashion?
        Have you automated accessibility testing but the service you are using has high latency, requires external access to your development server or requires you to send the HTML to a server for evaluation, compromising security and privacy?
        Did you disable accessibility assertions because of a high number of false positives and duplicates?
        Do you have to wade through reams of accessibility issues that have nothing to do with the feature you are developing before you get to the relevant items?
        aXe helps you catch accessibility issues early, driving down the cost and frustration of creating accessible Web applications. You can start enjoying the new way of building in accessibility testing into your code with aXe  – your Accessibility Engine.

        aXe runs on your local development server in the same browser as your functional or unit tests – making your test execution lightning fast, confidential and secure – unlike web service based testing services.
