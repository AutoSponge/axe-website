## Section 1: Introduction

The aXe API is designed to be an improvement over the previous generation of accessibility APIs. It provides the following benefits:

* Runs in any modern browser
* Designed to work with existing testing infrastructure
* Runs locally, no connection to a third-party server is necessary
* Performs violation checking on multiple levels of nested iframes
* Provides list of rules and elements that passed accessibility checking, ensuring rules have been run against entire document

### Getting Started
This section gives a quick description of how to use the aXe APIs to analyze web page content and return a JSON object that lists any accessibility violations found.

The aXe API can be used as part of a broader process that is performed on many, if not all, pages of a website. The API is used to analyze web page content and return a JSON object that lists any accessibility violations found. Here is how to get started:

1. Load page in testing system
2. Optionally, set configuration options for the javascript API (`axe.configure`)
3. Call analyze javascript API (`axe.run`)
4. Either assert against results or save them for later processing
